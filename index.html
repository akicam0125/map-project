    <!-- Story -->
  NEW YORK, NY -- While New York City is experiencing <a href=https://health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/ending_the_epidemic/docs/ete_beyond_2020_report.pdf> historic low</a> rates of HIV transmission since the discovery of the virus four decades ago, the city still accounts for over 20 percent of HIV infections nationwide. Access to antiviral medicine and treatment have improved in recent years, and infections have decreased significantly. However, premature death from HIV remains a key issue in the city.

  According to data from the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, death rates appear to be highest in neighborhoods with higher poverty levels and lower access to health care. Social and economic determinants to health remain a key indicator for health outcomes and premature deaths from diseases.

<p>

  In neighborhoods like <a href=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/2018chp-bx3.pdf> Morrisania</a> in the Bronx, lack of access to health care and resources are contributing factors to high HIV mortality rates. HIV-related illnesses rank third for premature death in the region, after cancer and heart disease. In addition, Morrisania residents only 12% of all adults have adequate access to healthcare, a rate higher than the NYC average. Over 16 out of 1000 people living with HIV in this neighborhoods have died from the disease in 2020, according to estimates by the Department of Health.

<p>

  In stark contrast are neighborhoods like Greenpoint, where the average median income of residents are $99,960. Neighborhoods with higher incomes also correlate strongly with lower death rates in the city. HIV death rates in this neighborhood hover at around 6.3 out of 1000 people living with HIV.

<p>

  Public health administrators in New York City are cognizant of the social and economic disparities that lead to such outcomes. To address the structural issues, the Department of Health, received the <a href=https://nyhiv.org/our-impact-2/> Ryan White Part A service directive</a>, a federal grant program that strengthens resources and operations for local community organizations who work with HIV-positive populations to receive adequate care and resources.

<p>

  "[The Department] looks forward to working with providers and community partners as we enter a new phase of our ending the epidemic efforts, ensuring our work is more deeply rooted in social and structural determinants of health, intersectionality, and equity," Guzman said in an email.
